# Digit Recognition Neural Network

## Overview
This project develops a neural network to accurately recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The focus was on fine-tuning the model by adjusting the number of hidden units and learning rates to optimize performance.

## Features
- Utilizes the MNIST dataset for training and testing.
- Experiments with various configurations to enhance accuracy.
- Implemented in Python, incorporating both forward and backpropagation algorithms.

## Results
Achieved high accuracy in digit classification, demonstrating the effectiveness of the chosen network architecture and parameter tuning.

## Usage
Run `MNIST_digits_NN.py` to train the neural network and test its digit recognition capabilities. Adjust the hidden units and learning rate as needed.

## Requirements
Python 3.x with NumPy, Matplotlib, and TensorFlow or similar libraries installed.
